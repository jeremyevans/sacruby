This was the code I wrote for the SacRuby Meetup in January 2014.
There were two exercises that meetup.  One was to write FizzBuzz
in a language you hadn't written a program in, the other was to
implement SimFrost (Ruby Quiz #117).

While I've used awk before for simple text manipulation, I've never
written a program in it, so I decided to use awk.  That was really
easy as awk is similar to C.

SimFrost took significantly more time, but I still finished both
in about an hour.
