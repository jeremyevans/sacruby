# Quiz 16: English Numerals

From ["Best of Ruby Quiz"](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Ruby-Quiz-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0976694077/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1481855515&sr=8-1&keywords=ruby+quiz)

Posed by Timothy Byrd

While we normally write numbers using Arabic numerals, numbers can also be written out as English phrases.

For example:

```
 	7    == seven
 	42   == forty-two
 	2001 == two thousand and one
 	1999 == one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
```

Given that, this quiz is a problem from a [Pi Mu Epsilon newsletter](http://www.pme-math.org)

When the integers 1 to 10,000,000,000 are written in the English language and then sorted as strings, which odd number appears first in the list?

Your task is to do the following:

1. Ruby code to translate a number to its English-language form. (My sample version works with integers less than 1072.)
1. a program to determine which odd number in between 1 and 10,000,000,000 would sort first if written in English. (Brute force is the obvious solution, but the computer may have to think about the answer....)”
