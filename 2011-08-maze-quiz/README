This contains a maze solver I wrote during the August 2011 Sacramento
Ruby Meetup.  I'm particularly proud of it as I finished first and
had the most accurate program, even finding bugs in the test program.
I think my solution is guaranteed to find the solution in the least
possible number of steps, and should have no false positives or false
negatives.
