This is a robot I wrote for the November 2012 Sacruby meeting.
It attempts to win by cheating, disabling other robots in various
ways by overwriting their method, and tries to protect against
similar cheating by other robots.

This is a slightly more polished version, fixing a stack overflow
that I missed on the hack night if robots loaded after robo
include another module after including Robot.

This code requires the rrobots library to run, see
