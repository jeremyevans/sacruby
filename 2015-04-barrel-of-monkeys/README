The April 2015 Ruby Meetup was doing ruby quiz #30: http://rubyquiz.com/quiz30.html

This was coded in about 2 hours and handles all cases for parsing the playlist.
The algorithm I used finds the shortest path if the path if finds if less than
5 songs, but if the path it finds is 5 or more songs, it may not be the shortest
path.
